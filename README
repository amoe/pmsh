WHAT IS IT?
-----------
It's a small program that takes commands in text mode and allows basic
manipulation of projectM.  The idea is to let you develop presets using a
standard text editor like Emacs, the same way you would use something like 'M-x
run-scheme', or, more traditionally, reloading your file in a separate console
window.


REQUIREMENTS
------------
emacs 22 (not checked)
pulseaudio
libprojectM
SDL

FIRST
-----
Copy your favourite projectM config to either ~/etc/pmsh.inp or ~/.pmsh.inp,
whatever floats your boat.
The code builds with cmake, ignore pmsh.mk


TO USE THE EMACS MODE
-------------------------

M-x load-file
type path to milkdrop-mode.el
load .milk file
M-x milkdrop-mode

will eventually be streamlined and given instructions to autoload


HOW TO USE INFERIOR MODE
------------------------
First, either define pmsh-program-name in your .emacs, or modify it in
inferior-pmsh-mode.el.  needs to be the path to the pmsh binary

M-x load-file
type path to inferior-pmsh-mode.el
M-x run-pmsh

Now you can send two commands from your preset or pmsh buffer:
C-c ; l: load preset (type path in minibuffer)
C-c ; r: reload preset from file
C-c ; x: exit

Enjoy ;)


Pulse issues
------------

Pulse seems to work quite badly on my system.
However, I think it's because pmsh is so slow, which is caused by a graphics
driver problem, not this code.
Therefore, a properly configured projectM shouldn't have this issue.
To test it:

First, kill any pulseaudio server you have running.
Start up one terminal.
Run 'pulseaudio -C'

Start up your PA-enabled player and start playing music.

Start up another terminal.
Run pmsh.

Now look at the first terminal, does it display any errors?
If not, all should be well.
On my system it says "Failed to push data into output queue." loads of times.
