IMPORTANT!!!
----------------------------

On my system there is a rare but present bug that LOCKS MY ENTIRE SYSTEM[*].
It occurs randomly, sometimes during shutdown, but can occur any time.  It
seems to sometimes be triggered by switching between windows.
It is intermittent.  I have no idea if it's caused by my code, projectm,
pulseaudio, my laptop, my video card, X.
I'd estimate its frequency at 1/100 runs (not easy to reproduce, but not exactly
uncommon either).
So PLEASE BEWARE when using this code, save everything you have running.

If you do experience this bug, please email me immediately!
If you don't experience it, email me as well!

[*]: Not quite true: the whole of X locks up, no mouse, no ctrl-alt-backspace,
but pressing the power button on my laptop causes it to shut down cleanly, or so
it seems - it switches itself off after ~30 seconds.

FIRST
-----
Copy your favourite projectM config to either ~/etc/pmsh.inp or ~/.pmsh.inp,
whatever floats your boat.

TO USE THE EMACS MODE
-------------------------

M-x load-file
type path to milkdrop-mode.el
load .milk file
M-x milkdrop-mode

will eventually be streamlined and given instructions to autoload


HOW TO USE INFERIOR MODE
------------------------
First, either define pmsh-program-name in your .emacs, or modify it in
inferior-pmsh-mode.el.  needs to be the path to the pmsh binary

M-x load-file
type path to inferior-pmsh-mode.el
M-x run-pmsh

Now you can send two commands from your preset buffer
(NB not *pmsh* at present):
C-c ; r: reload preset from file
C-c ; x: exit

Enjoy ;)

Pulse issues
------------

Pulse seems to work quite badly on my system.
However, I think it's because pmsh is so slow, which is caused by a graphics
driver problem, not this code.
Therefore, a properly configured projectM shouldn't have this issue.
To test it:

First, kill any pulseaudio server you have running.
Start up one terminal.
Run 'pulseaudio -C'

Start up your PA-enabled player and start playing music.

Start up another terminal.
Run pmsh.

Now look at the first terminal, does it display any errors?
If not, all should be well.
On my system it says "Failed to push data into output queue." loads of times.
