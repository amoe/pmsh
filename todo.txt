bugs

16:58 < amoe> bamf
16:58 < amoe> i know almost nothing about gdb
16:58 < amoe> stepping over my code managed to hard lock my whole system :)
16:59 < amoe> wasn't a pulseaudio call though
16:59 < amoe> anyway, does my pulseaudio need to be compiled with debugging
              symbols to be able to tell which syscall it's in?
17:01 < amoe> would probably be useful to have a debug version anyway, but last
              time i tried to compile pa something failed badly (can't remember
              what)
17:02 < amoe> i ran strace on it and the hang seems to happen at futex().  but
              that's probably not useful
17:04 < amoe> one more thing: i deactivated the worker thread and could still
              reproduce the hang.  worker thread enabled, it happens every
              time; disabled, it happens about every 5 times
17:05 < amoe> (that is, 4 times it'll get the lock immediately, 1 time it'll
              hang and require ctrl-\)
17:10 < amoe> well, just in case i've done it right:
17:10 < amoe> i've stepped over the hang now in gdb
17:10 < amoe> pressed ctrl-C
17:10 < amoe> i'll paste the output now
17:12 < amoe> http://paste.lisp.org/display/66496
17:13 < amoe> if gdb normally shows syscalls even without debug symbols, i can
              confirm that no threads are in poll(), since absolutely no info
              is shown at all :)
17:18 < amoe> aside: if i do want to build PA with debug symbols, how do i do
              that?  can't see anything in ./configure --help
17:24 < coling> amoe, check the bootstrap file.. it's a matter of passing the
                right cflags
17:27 < amoe> cheers coling, will do
