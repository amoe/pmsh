TODO

makefile should use pkg-config
please note that we are currently using configfile linked from projectM,
though it is not declared in any pM header and is not part of the public
interface
good or bad?

ERROR: ; should not indicate a comment in per-frame code.

inferior-pmsh:
- add l that concats current filename 

pmsh:
- pulseaudio support
  * algorithm:
  * get first monitor source
  * use pa_simple_new to hook it up with the dev parameter
  * read data with pa_simple_read
  * can be in any sample format.  match this to pcm16
  * if blocking does not introduce large performance fuckups, ths will suffice
- cmd 'd': add directory of presets
- cmd 'n': next
- cmd 'p': prev
- pass events thru to milkdrop?

20:43 < amoe> is it possible to use the pulseaudio API to read the final mixed output stream?
20:47 < sjoerd> pulse has a monitor soruce on each sink
20:48 < sjoerd> which gives you exactly the stream going to the sink
20:48 < amoe> i would need to use the async api for that?
20:52 < amoe> aha, pa_sink_info.monitor_source
21:01 -!- ensonic [n=ensonic@pdpc/supporter/active/ensonic] has quit ["Leaving"]
21:13 < amoe> ahh, here's what i do: somehow get the name of the monitor source, then i can pass it as
              the device parameter to either pa_simple_new() or pa_simple_connect_record()
21:13 < amoe> nifty
21:14 < amoe> so i probably can use the simple api, if it will get bytes fast enough

BUGS:

* Hard lock - able to press power button
  This is the most serious, no idea what causes it
* Segfault at exit
  Incorrect locking?
* Xlib: unexpected async reply (sequence 0x7d)!
  Incorrect locking?

Can I trigger any of these with the lock held in cleanup()?
